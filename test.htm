      (born March 9, 1983) is an American professional soccer player who plays
      for Seattle Sounders FC in Major League Soccer and has served as the
      captain of the United States national team. He has also played for New
      England Revolution, Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing up in Nacogdoches, Texas, Dempsey played for one of the top youth
      soccer clubs in the state, the Dallas Texans, before playing for Furman
      University's men's soccer team. In 2004, Dempsey was drafted by Major
      League Soccer club New England Revolution, where he quickly integrated
      himself into the starting lineup. Hindered initially by a jaw injury, he
      would eventually score 25 goals in 71 appearances with the Revolution.
      Between 2007 and 2012, Dempsey played for Premier League team Fulham and
      is the club's highest Premier League goalscorer of all time. Dempsey
      became the first American player to score a hat-trick in the English
      Premier League, in the 5–2 win over Newcastle United in January 2012.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dempsey first represented the United States at the 2003 FIFA World Youth
      Championship and made his first appearance with the senior team on
      November 17, 2004, against Jamaica. He has earned over 100 caps and scored
      48 international goals, making him the nation's sixth-most capped player
      and second top scorer of all time. He has represented the nation at four
      CONCACAF Gold Cups (winning two), helped them to the final of the 2009
      FIFA Confederations Cup and played at three FIFA World Cups, becoming the
      first American male to score in three World Cups.

    <h2><span id="Early_life_and_career">Early life and career</span></h2>
    <p>
      Dempsey was born in Nacogdoches, Texas, and, for much of his childhood,
      his family lived in a trailer park, where he and his siblings grew up
      playing soccer with Hispanic immigrants. In his teens, Dempsey maintained
      these ties playing in a local Mexican-dominated adult league. Dempsey is
      of Irish descent on his father's side. His older brother Ryan was offered
      a tryout for the Dallas Texans, an elite youth soccer club, and brought
      Clint, who was noticed and recruited while passing time juggling a ball on
      the sidelines. Dempsey became a standout on the team at an early age but
      had to quit due to his family's time and money constraints as his eldest
      sister Jennifer was becoming a ranked youth tennis player. Several parents
      of his teammates with the Texans offered to assist the Dempseys with
      expenses and travel, allowing him to rejoin the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      On November 27, 1995, Dempsey lost his then 16-year-old sister Jennifer to
      a brain aneurysm. Dempsey was devastated with the family's loss and later
      explained that this event helped him develop a deeper motivation to pursue
      soccer in honor of his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on to be the captain and high scorer of the Texans and was honored
      with the MVP of the Tampa Bay Sun Bowl tournament. Dempsey studied the
      play of Argentina's national team, especially Diego Maradona, and was
      heartbroken when the news came to Nacogdoches that Maradona would not be
      playing in the 1994 World Cup game played in the Cotton Bowl. He attended
      Furman University as a health and exercise science major and a key player
      for Paladins soccer.

      New England Revolution selected Clint Dempsey eighth overall in the 2004
      MLS SuperDraft. In his rookie season, he started 23 of 24 matches scoring
      seven goals. Dempsey helped the Revolution to the Eastern Conference
      Finals and earned 2004 MLS Rookie of the Year Honors. In 2005, Dempsey
      contributed ten goals and nine assists in 26 games. He scored the
      game-winning goal in the Eastern Conference Final on his way to an
      appearance in the MLS Cup Final. In 2006, Dempsey added 8 more goals, but
      missed significant time in the playoffs due to injury. He came on as a
      substitute in the MLS Cup Final, but the Revolution lost their second
      straight final, this time in a penalty shoot-out (largely because Dempsey
      opted out of the PK, and it ended up scuffed off Jay Heaps' foot instead).

      Before moving to Fulham, Dempsey went for a trial at ŁKS Łomża where the
      coach sent him to Fulham. In December 2006, English club Fulham offered
      MLS $4 million for the transfer of Dempsey, then the largest amount ever
      offered for an MLS player, and he became another American addition to a
      <i>Cottagers'</i> squad which included US internationals Brian McBride and
      Carlos Bocanegra. On January 11, 2007, he was granted a work permit from
      the Home Office as Fulham announced his signing on a long-term deal. This
      made Dempsey the most expensive American export to the Premier League in a
      deal worth a reported £2 million. He made his Fulham debut in a 1–1 home
      draw against Tottenham Hotspur on January 20, 2007. His FA Cup debut
      followed seven days later in a 3–0 home win over Stoke City. Dempsey
      scored his first goal for Fulham on 5 May when he struck the only goal of
      a 1–0 home win over Liverpool. This goal saved Fulham from relegation and
      effectively guaranteed their place in the top-flight for the following
      season.
