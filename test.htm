      (born March 9, 1983) is an American professional soccer player who plays
      for Seattle Sounders FC in Major League Soccer and has served as the
      captain of the United States national team. He has also played for New
      England Revolution, Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing up in Nacogdoches, Texas, Dempsey played for one of the top youth
      soccer clubs in the state, the Dallas Texans, before playing for Furman
      University's men's soccer team. In 2004, Dempsey was drafted by Major
      League Soccer club New England Revolution, where he quickly integrated
      himself into the starting lineup. Hindered initially by a jaw injury, he
      would eventually score 25 goals in 71 appearances with the Revolution.
      Between 2007 and 2012, Dempsey played for Premier League team Fulham and
      is the club's highest Premier League goalscorer of all time. Dempsey
      became the first American player to score a hat-trick in the English
      Premier League, in the 5–2 win over Newcastle United in January 2012.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dempsey first represented the United States at the 2003 FIFA World Youth
      Championship and made his first appearance with the senior team on
      November 17, 2004, against Jamaica. He has earned over 100 caps and scored
      48 international goals, making him the nation's sixth-most capped player
      and second top scorer of all time. He has represented the nation at four
      CONCACAF Gold Cups (winning two), helped them to the final of the 2009
      FIFA Confederations Cup and played at three FIFA World Cups, becoming the
      first American male to score in three World Cups.

    <h2><span id="Early_life_and_career">Early life and career</span></h2>
    <p>
      Dempsey was born in Nacogdoches, Texas, and, for much of his childhood,
      his family lived in a trailer park, where he and his siblings grew up
      playing soccer with Hispanic immigrants. In his teens, Dempsey maintained
      these ties playing in a local Mexican-dominated adult league. Dempsey is
      of Irish descent on his father's side. His older brother Ryan was offered
      a tryout for the Dallas Texans, an elite youth soccer club, and brought
      Clint, who was noticed and recruited while passing time juggling a ball on
      the sidelines. Dempsey became a standout on the team at an early age but
      had to quit due to his family's time and money constraints as his eldest
      sister Jennifer was becoming a ranked youth tennis player. Several parents
      of his teammates with the Texans offered to assist the Dempseys with
      expenses and travel, allowing him to rejoin the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      On November 27, 1995, Dempsey lost his then 16-year-old sister Jennifer to
      a brain aneurysm. Dempsey was devastated with the family's loss and later
      explained that this event helped him develop a deeper motivation to pursue
      soccer in honor of his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on to be the captain and high scorer of the Texans and was honored
      with the MVP of the Tampa Bay Sun Bowl tournament. Dempsey studied the
      play of Argentina's national team, especially Diego Maradona, and was
      heartbroken when the news came to Nacogdoches that Maradona would not be
      playing in the 1994 World Cup game played in the Cotton Bowl. He attended
      Furman University as a health and exercise science major and a key player
      for Paladins soccer.

    <h3><span id="New_England_Revolution">New England Revolution</span></h3>
    <p>
      New England Revolution selected Clint Dempsey eighth overall in the 2004
      MLS SuperDraft. In his rookie season, he started 23 of 24 matches scoring
      seven goals. Dempsey helped the Revolution to the Eastern Conference
      Finals and earned 2004 MLS Rookie of the Year Honors. In 2005, Dempsey
      contributed ten goals and nine assists in 26 games. He scored the
      game-winning goal in the Eastern Conference Final on his way to an
      appearance in the MLS Cup Final. In 2006, Dempsey added 8 more goals, but
      missed significant time in the playoffs due to injury. He came on as a
      substitute in the MLS Cup Final, but the Revolution lost their second
      straight final, this time in a penalty shoot-out (largely because Dempsey
      opted out of the PK, and it ended up scuffed off Jay Heaps' foot instead).

    <h4><span id="2006.E2.80.9307_season">2006–07 season</span></h4>
    <p>
      Before moving to Fulham, Dempsey went for a trial at ŁKS Łomża where the
      coach sent him to Fulham. In December 2006, English club Fulham offered
      MLS $4 million for the transfer of Dempsey, then the largest amount ever
      offered for an MLS player, and he became another American addition to a
      <i>Cottagers'</i> squad which included US internationals Brian McBride and
      Carlos Bocanegra. On January 11, 2007, he was granted a work permit from
      the Home Office as Fulham announced his signing on a long-term deal. This
      made Dempsey the most expensive American export to the Premier League in a
      deal worth a reported £2 million. He made his Fulham debut in a 1–1 home
      draw against Tottenham Hotspur on January 20, 2007. His FA Cup debut
      followed seven days later in a 3–0 home win over Stoke City. Dempsey
      scored his first goal for Fulham on 5 May when he struck the only goal of
      a 1–0 home win over Liverpool. This goal saved Fulham from relegation and
      effectively guaranteed their place in the top-flight for the following
      season.
    </p>
    <h4><span id="2007.E2.80.9308_season">2007–08 season</span></h4>
    <p>
      Dempsey was not in the starting XI for the first three matches of the
      2007–08 season, but after an injury to Brian McBride, he came into the
      side as a striker and scored in a 2–1 defeat at Aston Villa. He followed
      this up by scoring in Fulham's next fixture in a 3–3 home draw against
      Tottenham on September 1. Two weeks later, he opened the scoring in
      Fulham's 1–1 away draw against Wigan Athletic. These goals gave Dempsey
      three in as many games. On September 29, Dempsey was involved in an aerial
      collision with John Terry during a 0–0 draw at Stamford Bridge which
      resulted in Terry being substituted. There was some suggestion that
      Dempsey used a deliberate elbow on Terry; however, he wasn't punished for
      the incident as referee Martin Atkinson didn't report it to The Football
      Association (The FA). On November 3, Dempsey scored during Fulham's 3–1
      home win over Reading to secure just a second league win of the season. He
      scored his last goals of the season in a 1–1 home draw with Wigan Athletic
      and 5–1 away loss to Tottenham in December. In May 2008, Fulham announced
      Dempsey had signed a contract extension which would keep him at the club
      until the summer of 2010. Fulham beat Portsmouth 1–0 on the final day of
      the season to secure Premier League status for another year. He ended the
      season as Fulham's top Premier League goalscorer with six goals.
    </p>
    <h4><span id="2008.E2.80.9309_season">2008–09 season</span></h4>
    <p>
      Dempsey made the Fulham XI only once in the first eleven fixtures of the
      2008–09 season but scored his first goal in a 1–1 away draw at Portsmouth
      on October 26 after coming on as a substitute. He replaced Zoltan Gera in
      the side and scored his first home goal of the season in a 3–0 win over
      Middlesbrough on December 20. Eight days later he scored twice in the West
      London derby against Chelsea which included a last-minute equalizer in a
      2–2 home draw. On February 24, 2009, Dempsey scored the first FA Cup goal
      of his career in a 2–1 home win over Swansea City in the fifth-round. His
      final home goal of the season came in a 2–1 defeat to Blackburn Rovers on
      March 11. Fulham came from a goal down to beat Manchester City 3–1 away
      from home as Dempsey scored two goals on April 12. For the second
      successive season, Dempsey ended as Fulham's top Premier League goalscorer
      joint with Andrew Johnson with seven goals. These goals helped Fulham
      secure a seventh-place finish in the Premier League, the highest in the
      club's history, and confirmed their qualification for the newly formed
      UEFA Europa League for the following season.
    </p>
    <h4><span id="2009.E2.80.9310_season">2009–10 season</span></h4>

    <p>
      On August 13, 2009, Dempsey signed a contract extension to remain with
      Fulham through 2013. On August 20, he scored his first goal in European
      competition, in the new Europa League, netting Fulham's second goal in a
      3–1 win against Amkar Perm in the play-off round. On December 30,
      <i>La Gazzetta dello Sport</i> named Dempsey as one of the top eleven
      Premier League players of the season. On January 17, 2010, Dempsey
      suffered a suspected cruciate knee ligament injury in a 2–0 away defeat to
      Blackburn Rovers. On March 11, Dempsey returned, coming on in the last
      minute of Fulham's loss away to Juventus, and then completed 72 minutes of
      their away loss to Manchester United in the league. On March 18, Dempsey
      came off the bench against Juventus in their second-leg, last-16 tie in
      the Europa League and scored the winner on a long chip shot. Fulham won
      the game 4–1 and this game resulted in Fulham winning an award, as well as
      Dempsey receiving an award for his goal. <i>The Guardian</i> suggested
      that the goal "might become the most famous goal in Fulham's history". On
      May 12, Dempsey replaced Bobby Zamora in the 55th minute of the 2010 UEFA
      Europa League Final, thus making history in becoming the first ever
      American to appear in a major European final. In the end, Fulham lost the
      match, as Atlético Madrid's Diego Forlán scored in the 116th minute of
      extra time, giving Atlético a 2–1 win. His performances throughout 2009–10
      earned him the designation of Most Valuable Player among Americans in
      Europe by SoccerOverThere.com, among other sources.
    </p>
    <h4><span id="2010.E2.80.9311_season">2010–11 season</span></h4>
    <p>
      Dempsey was on the substitutes' bench for Fulham's first two away games of
      2010–11, but became a regular starter, one of only five USA players in the
      Premier League to do so. On September 18, 2010, he scored an equalizing
      goal on 56 minutes with a header against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in
      the 1–1 draw to continue Fulham's unbeaten record in the Barclays Premier
      League. On October 2, he scored against West Ham United past Robert Green,
      the same keeper that he had scored against in the World Cup. He then
      continued his form by scoring two goals against Wigan Athletic on October
      30 as Fulham ran out 2–0 winners. On January 22, 2011, Dempsey scored
      another double versus Stoke City, putting Fulham temporarily out of
      relegation contention.
    </p>
    <p>
      On March 19, Dempsey became the first USA player to score 10 goals in a
      Premier League season, beating Brian McBride's previous record of nine,
      also set while at Fulham in the 2005–06 season and 2006–07 season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clint Dempsey broke Fulham's Premier League goalscoring record by netting
      twice in a 3–0 victory over Bolton on April 27, 2011. He has scored a
      total of 33 goals for the team in the Premier League, topping both Brian
      McBride and Steed Malbranque, each with 32. With these goals, he scored 12
      goals for Fulham in the 2010–11 season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dempsey was voted Fulham player of the season for 2010–11 by the Fulham
      fans, and his 12 Premier League strikes meant he was the club's leading
      goalscorer for the campaign.
    </p>
    <h4><span id="2011.E2.80.9312_season">2011–12 season</span></h4>
    <p>
      Dempsey scored a brace in the first leg of Fulham's 2011–12 Europa League
      play-off clash against Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk at Craven Cottage. Dempsey
      ended with two goals as Fulham ran out 3–0 winners, setting up a
      comfortable second leg in Ukraine. On December 5, 2011, Dempsey scored in
      the 85th minute to secure a 1–0 win against Liverpool at Craven Cottage.
      The goal propelled Dempsey to become the most prolific USA goalscorer in
      the Premier League, passing Fulham legend and fellow American Brian
      McBride. Dempsey scored his fifth Premier League goal of the campaign with
      a header in a 2–0 home win against Bolton on December 17, lifting his side
      six points clear of the drop zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the club's West London derby against rivals Chelsea on Boxing Day,
      Dempsey scored the equalizing goal as the game ended in a 1–1 draw. He
      then became the second American to post a hat trick in the FA Cup behind
      Chris Cleary with his first hat-trick of his career on January 7 against
      Charlton Athletic in their FA Cup Third Round game that ended in a 4–0
      victory. On January 21, 2012, Dempsey scored his first Premier League
      hat-trick against Newcastle while the game ended in a 5–2 win for Fulham
      and sent his goal tally in the Premier League to nine for the season. With
      his hat-trick against Newcastle, he became the first ever USA player to
      score a hat-trick in the Premier League. Dempsey scored his 10th Premier
      League goal of the season, sixteenth in all competitions, in a 1–1 draw
      against former manager Roy Hodgson's West Brom on February 1, 2012. This
      run of good form saw Dempsey play higher-up the field into an orthodox
      striker position.
    </p>
    <p>
      He "assisted" another goal in a 2–1 win against Stoke City on February 11,
      2012. His 28th-minute shot hit the crossbar and was deflected by Stoke
      goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen. It was therefore awarded as an own goal off
      the goalie. His form this season continued against Wolverhampton Wanderers
      where Dempsey scored twice in a 5–0 victory for Fulham.
    </p>
    <p>
      On March 8, 2012, the day before Dempsey's 29th birthday, Fulham manager
      Martin Jol revealed that the club had opened talks with the North American
      over a new three-year contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dempsey scored his fourteenth and fifteenth Premier League goals of the
      campaign, bringing his tally to twenty-one in all competitions, in a 3–0
      away win over Bolton Wanderers on April 7, the first a free kick and the
      second a header. The strikes moved Dempsey past Louis Saha's record of
      thirteen Premier League goals for the club in a single season. Dempsey
      finished fourth on the FWA Footballer of the Year list behind the winner,
      Arsenal's Robin van Persie, and Manchester United pair Wayne Rooney and
      Paul Scholes, who came in second and third, respectively. Dempsey became
      the first USA player to reach the milestone of fifty goals in the Premier
      League, with a free kick against Sunderland in the last home game of the
      season.
